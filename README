#100 days of Coding.

This repository is a collection of programs done during the 100 days of Coding Challenge.

Day 0:
Started with some simple code on bits manipulation.

Prog1 : Find if the number is a power of 2.
The simplest solution to this problem is by using the AND operation of the number and
number -1.

Prog2 : Find how many bits are different comparing 2 numbers.

EXOR A and B to find out the exact number of bits that are different.
Now use shift operation to find if the LSB is 1 and then right shift by 1.

Keep track of the count.

Prog3 : Find the rightmost different bit.

This is similar to the above program with a small difference.
when you find the right most bit that is set return the count.
